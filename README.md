# Plastic to Power: Microwave Energy for Plastic Decomposition

This repository is dedicated to **Plastic to Power: Microwave Energy for Plastic Decomposition**, a final-year engineering project at the University of Cape Town. This project explores the use of microwave-assisted catalytic pyrolysis (MAP) to convert plastic waste into hydrogen and valuable by-products like carbon nanotubes.

## Project Overview
This project investigates the role of microplasmas and hotspot identification within the microwave cavity to improve efficiency and consistency in hydrogen production. It also examines the performance differences between inverter and transformer microwaves to determine the optimal conditions for large-scale, sustainable plastic waste conversion.
